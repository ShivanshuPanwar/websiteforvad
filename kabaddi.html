                Modern kabaddi is a synthesis of the game played in various forms under different names in the Indian subcontinent.[9] India has been first credited with having helped to popularise kabaddi as a competitive sport, with the first organized competitions occurring in the 1920s,[10] their introduction to the programme of the Indian Olympic Games in 1938, the establishment of the All-India Kabaddi Federation in 1950,[10] and it being played as a demonstration sport at the inaugural 1951 Asian Games in New Delhi.

   <h3>Variations</h3>
   <p><strong> Standard Style</strong> 
    In the international team version of kabaddi, two teams of seven members each occupy opposite halves of a court of 10 by 13 metres (33 ft × 43 ft) in case of men and 8 by 12 metres (26 ft × 39 ft) in case of women.[10] Each has five supplementary players held in reserve for substitution.[10] The game is played with 20-minute halves with a 5-minute half time break in which the teams exchange sides.[10] During each play, known as a "raid", a player from the attacking side, known as the "raider", runs into the opposing team's side of the court and attempts to tag as many of the seven defending players as possible. The raider must cross the baulk line into the defending team's territory, and then return to their half of the field without being tackled. (If an attacker touches a defender and hasn't yet reached the baulk line, they don't need to reach the baulk line to score points and may return to their half of the court.)[12] While raiding, the raider must loudly chant kabaddi, confirming to referees that their raid is done on a single breath without inhaling. Each raid has a 30-second time limit.<br>

    <p>
    <strong> Modern Style</strong><br>
    There are four major forms of Indian kabaddi recognised by the amateur federation.[4] In Sanjeevani kabaddi, one player is revived against one player of the opposite team who is out. The game is played over 40 minutes with a five-minute break between halves. There are seven players on each side and the team that outs all the players on the opponent's side scores four extra points. In Gaminee style, seven players play on each side and a player put out has to remain out until all his team members are out. The team that is successful in outing all the players of the opponent's side secures a point. The game continues until five or seven such points are secured and has no fixed time duration. Amar style resembles the Sanjeevani form in the time frame rule, but a player who is declared out stays inside the court while play continues. For every player of the opposition touched "out", a team earns a point.

        <p>
            The following competitions are played in standard format
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 style="text-align: center , ;">Kabaddi World Cup</h2>
        <p>The Kabaddi World Cup is an outdoor international standard style kabaddi competition conducted by the International Kabaddi Federation (IKF), contested by men's and women's national teams. The competition has been previously contested in 2004, 2007 and 2016. All the tournaments have been won by India. India defeated Iran by 38–29 in the final of the championship game to clinch the title of 2016.</p>
            <h2 style="text-align: center , ;">Asian Games</h2>
            <p>Kabaddi was played as a demonstration event at the First Asian Games in 1951,[5][6][7] and again in 1982,[11] before becoming a medal event for the first time in 1990.[11]

                The Indian national team won every men's and women's kabaddi competition in the Asian Games from 2002 through 2014. At the 2018 Asian Games, Iran became the first country other than India to win gold medals in kabaddi, with India's men's team winning bronze, and India's women's team being beaten by Iran to win silver.</p>
            <h2 style="text-align: center , ;">Pro Kabaddi League</h2>
            <p>The Pro Kabaddi League was established in 2014.[24] The league modeled its business upon that of the Indian Premier League of Twenty20 cricket, with a large focus on marketing, the backing of local broadcaster Star Sports, and changes to the sport's rules and its presentation to make it more suitable for a television audience.[25] The Pro Kabaddi League quickly became a ratings success on Indian television; the 2014 season was watched by at least 435 million viewers over the course of the season, and the inaugural championship match was seen by 98.6 million viewers.</p>
